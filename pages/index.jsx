            Interestingly enough, out of everything I've done, my coding
            experience is probably the least impressive part of my resume. I was
            an Applied Mathematics major until my 3rd year at UCSD, when I
            realized that Computer Science was so much more fun. I've built this
            website, so I clearly enjoy messing around with web development,
            especially with React frameworks, and I have also been exposed to
            Angular and enjoy the challenge Angular presents.

            It seems like university always steers students in the direction of
            software engineering. I have actually thoroughly enjoyed working
            closely with algorithms and optimizing problems that these classes
            introduced. For now, web development is calling my name, but I am
            open to the idea of exploring other paths in technology and learning
            as much as I can. Over the past year, I've done just that: explore.
            First, I switched my major to Math and Computer Sciences so I could
            explore the coursework. I looked into machine learning and very
            quickly left that for another time, worked on a minecraft mod and
            rediscovered how fun Java was to work with, then I typed in{" "}
            <b>create-react-app</b> and the world of the web opened its arms to
            me.

              I was fortunate to grow up in Riverside, California, where despite
              the eternal heat, I was surrounded by nature and wildlife. I can't
              remember a time when hearing coyotes yipping excitedly surprised
              me, or when the large and persistent stink beetles bugged me. With
              the exception of a few wasps and many Black Widows, I really grew
              to appreciate the world around me.
