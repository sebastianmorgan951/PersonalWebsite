              I only discovered my love for Computer Sciences during my 3
              <sup>rd</sup> year at UCSD. I was an Applied Mathematics major
              until my 3<sup>rd</sup> year, when I realized that Computer
              Science felt much more concrete and personally fulfilling. I've
              built this website and I enjoy web development, especially using
              React frameworks, though I have experience with Angular and enjoy
              the challenge Angular presents.

              It seems like UCSD always steers students in the direction of
              software engineering. I have thoroughly enjoyed working closely
              with algorithms and optimizing problems that these classes
              introduced. At this moment I am deeply interested in web
              development, but I am open to the idea of exploring other paths in
              technology and learning as much as I can. Over the past year, I've
              done just that: explore. First, I switched my major to Math and
              Computer Sciences so I could immerse myself more deeply in
              Computer Sciences. I looked into machine learning and prompty left
              that for another time, worked on a minecraft mod and rediscovered
              how fun Java was to work with, then I typed in{" "}

              How did I build this Website?

              Check out the Github repository for this website! You can follow
              the <b>button below</b> for the code. I used tailwindcss to style
              most of the components, this allowed me deploy this application
              fairly quickly, however this came at the cost of not thinking to
              build a more reusable component-driven application.
              <br />
              <br />
              To speed up load times, I used the built-in NextJS Image
              components, which are lazy loading by default, and reduced the
              image size for all non-cover images. To create an aspect ratio for
              the images, I created a relatively positioned div to contain each
              image, and set a percent width and percent <b>padding top</b> on
              the div. I set the padding top, as the padding top percent is with
              regards to the width of the parent element, giving us a div with a
              fixed length:width ratio. The image is then absolutely positioned
              within this div, and you give it a width 100% and height 100% (in
              NextJS this means setting the layout to fill), and top and left 0.
              Finally, you make the image objectfit attribute equal to cover,
              and you're done.
              <br />
              <br />
              I only used one package other than tailwindcss on this
              application, and the package was to simplify the built-in
              intersection observer so I could detect when the user had scrolled
              a certain amount more easily rather than listening to scroll
              events, which would hinder the performance of the website. I
              recommend you try to resize your screen to break this layout, I
              have designed it with different screen sizes in mind so I hope
              that my design is robust in any circumstance!
              <br />
              <br />I spent about one and a half weeks working on this website
              for an average of 3-4 hours a day. Much of that time was spent
              thinking up creative ways to make this home page fun for the user.
              Try to find all of the easter eggs around this website, all of
              them are fairly obvious, but are kind of fun (: Also use devtools
              to see how some of these animations were implemented, they were
              fun to figure out!
